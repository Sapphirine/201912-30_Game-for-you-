# Game for you！
## Abstract:
This github is to provide our code of final project “Game for you”. In the project, we used multiple computer languages and techniques (such as python, SQL, HTML, NLP) and different analytic algorithms to solve the problems including data cleaning and calculation, game recommendation and website data visualization. Finally, we created a simple and practical game recommendation website based on two datasets about games.
